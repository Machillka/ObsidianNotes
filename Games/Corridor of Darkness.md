## Summary

The player is a boy/girl who are trapped in a house with scary ghost. The house is so dark that we are not allowed to see the escape path directly.  The only light is the sound waves that caused by stepping or fire a sound ray. Use the only light to find the escape path, cross the corridors of darkness. Remember, be careful about the ghost. Once you are caught by the ghost, the game will end immediately.
